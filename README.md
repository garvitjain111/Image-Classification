# Image-Classification
Implemented ResNet model for image classification. over CIFAR-100 data set.


ResNet implementation for Image classification and labeling.

ResNet, an alias for Residual Network, is a form of neural network introduced in 2015 by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun in their paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition."
ResNet was a cutting-edge method compared to VGG-like models:


We achieve over 70% accuracy in 100 epochs without using any pre-trained models, demonstrating the potential of ResNet.
To acquire results in a reasonable period of time, I'll be using a less sophisticated version of ResNets in this notebook. Although the CIFAR-100 dataset is utilized for the implementation, it may be used for any image classification dataset.
